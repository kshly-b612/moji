		Rhythm versus conduction

Your heart rhythm is the way your heart beats. Conduction is how electrical impulses travel through your heart, which causes it to beat. Some conduction disorders can cause arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats.

Three common conduction disorders are:
Bundle branch block
Explaining the problem

Normally, electrical impulses travel down the right and left branches of the ventricles at the same speed. This allows both ventricles to contract simultaneously.

But when there’s a “block” in one of the branches, electrical signals have to take a different path through the ventricle. This detour means that one ventricle contracts a fraction of a second slower than the other, causing an arrhythmia.
Symptoms and diagnosis

A person with bundle branch block may experience no symptoms, especially in the absence of any other problems.

In such cases, bundle branch block is usually first identified by testing for some other reason, such as a routine physical. An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) reveals bundle branch block when it measures the heart’s electrical impulses.
Treatment

Often, no treatment is required for bundle branch block.

But it’s still important to have regular checkups. Your doctor will want to monitor your condition to make sure that no other changes occur.
